_Explain how typing is often overlooked as a critical skill for web developers but is essential to their success._
    
## The importance of typing speed
Discuss how typing speed can affect a developer's workflow, productivity, and ability to meet deadlines. Highlight the benefits of being able to type quickly and accurately, such as faster coding and reduced errors.

## The role of ergonomics
Explain how proper typing technique and ergonomic set-up can prevent injury and improve comfort during long coding sessions.
    
## Resources for improving typing skills
Provide tips and resources for improving typing skills, such as typing courses, keyboard shortcuts, and text expanders.
    
## Conclusion
Summarize the importance of typing skills for web developers and encourage readers to prioritize improving their typing skills.

## Additional points we could add to the article:

- Discuss how typing skills can vary depending on the type of web development work a developer is doing. For example, front-end developers may focus more on HTML and CSS, while back-end developers may need to type more in programming languages like Python or Java.

- Mention the importance of being able to type while looking at the screen (i.e., touch typing) rather than looking at the keyboard. This skill can greatly improve a developer's productivity and accuracy.

- Provide examples of keyboard shortcuts that can save time and reduce typing errors, such as using Ctrl+C to copy and Ctrl+V to paste.

- Mention the potential negative effects of poor typing habits, such as hand and wrist strain, and how this can lead to repetitive strain injuries (RSI) and other long-term health issues.

- Encourage readers to take breaks and stretch regularly to prevent injury and improve focus during long coding sessions.

## Make a visual chart that show these metrics in French

10-30 wpm: At this speed, your typing speed is way below average, and you should focus on proper typing technique (explained below).

40 wpm: At 41 wpm, you are now an average typist. You still have significant room for improvement.

50 wpm: You’re above average.

60 wpm: This is the speed required for most high-end typing jobs. You can now be a professional typist!

70 wpm: You are way above average! You would qualify for any typing job assuming your typing accuracy is high enough.

80 wpm: You’re a catch! Any employer looking for a typist would love to have you.

90 wpm: At this typing speed, you’re probably a gamer, coder, or genius.

100 wpm or more: You are in the top 1% of typists!
